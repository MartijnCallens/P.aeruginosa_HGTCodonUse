# Scripts for the data analysis performed in "Evolutionary responses to codon usage of horizontally transferred genes in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*"

Code for the data analysis of our Microbial Genomics paper "Evolutionary responses to codon usage of horizontally transferred genes in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*: gene retention, amelioration and compensatory evolution" is currently being updated...

If you have specific questions, please contact me on the correspondance address mentioned in the paper.

The code in this repository can be used to perform the bioinformatics pipeline to infer horizontal gene transfers in a set of full genome sequences from multipe strains of a bacterial species. The general outline is presented in the figure below.

These files contain the code for specific parts of the analysis:
* Obtain_data.md: get the genome data to run the analysis
* Pan_genome_analysis.md: extract core and accessory genes (block A in the figure below)
